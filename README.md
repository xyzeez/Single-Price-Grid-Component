## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt how to use grid properly in ths challenge and I'd use the following vchallenges to master the grid positioning. I, however, remain a flexbox fan!

### Continued development

As mentioned, I'd like to further more on projects involving grid layouting to improve my skill on that.


### Useful resources

- [CSS Generator](https://cssgenerator.org/box-shadow-css-generator.html) - This helped me with the box shadow. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
